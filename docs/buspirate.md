# BUS PIRATE

It's a multi-purpose tool to interface with a lot of protocols. It's built on top
a PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller. It's all open source ([github repo](https://github.com/DangerousPrototypes/Bus_Pirate))
and the ``PIC`` can be programmed following this [post](https://hackaday.com/2010/11/03/how-to-program-pics-using-linux/).

A note about versioning: exist three different versions:

 - the hardware
 - the firmware
 - the bootloader

[Home](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate) | [Code](https://github.com/DangerousPrototypes/Bus_Pirate)

In order to use bus pirate you have to connect to it with a serial terminal; I will use the terminal
included with the PySerial (``# pip install pyserial``)

    $ python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud=115200 --lf

(if you want is possible to use screen: ``screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 8N1``).

Follow the [cable pinout](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Common_Bus_Pirate_cable_pinouts)

In order to connect to the an UART port

```
$ python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud=115200 --lf
--- Miniterm on /dev/ttyUSB0: 115200,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+]  |  Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---

## Pinouts

Exist different versions of cable colors, in this text we use the [seeedstudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Bus-Pirate-Cable-p-932.html) one

![PIN SCHEME](Images/Bp-pin-cable-color.png)

### Mode

There is a tricky behaviour with pullup resistor and **open collector mode** and **normal pin mode**,
read more [here](https://hackaday.com/2009/07/01/mixed-voltage-interfacing-with-the-bus-pirate/).

## Bus modes

### HiZ

In this mode all the pins are set as **high impedence**.

### 1-Wire

## Utilities

### Power supply

With the ``w/W`` it's possible to de/activate the power supply (it's not possible
in ``HiZ`` mode).

### ADC reading

The ``ADC`` pin can read voltage using the ``d`` or ``D`` command.

```
1-WIRE>D
VOLTMETER MODE
Any key to exit
VOLTAGE PROBE: 2.10V
```

## Bootloader

The BP has a bootloader, in hardware v3 can be accessed with the ``pirate-loader`` console
program that you can found in this [repo](https://code.google.com/p/the-bus-pirate/source/checkout)**moved to github**.

To activate the bootloader you have to connect the pins ``PGC`` ``PGD`` like the
image below:

![jumper for bootloader activation](Images/Bpv3-upgrade-jumper.jpg)

Otherwise is possible to activate it from the console itself

```
HiZ>$
BOOTLOADER
```

**Remember to turn off your terminal to free the serial port before proceeding.** If the
process fail for some reason, you can always reactivate it with the jumpers.

```
$ sudo ./pirate-loader_lnx --dev=/dev/ttyUSB0 --hello
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  Pirate-Loader for BP with Bootloader v4+  
  Loader version: 1.0.2  OS: Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Opening serial device /dev/ttyUSB0...OK
Configuring serial port settings...OK
Sending Hello to the Bootloader...OK

Device ID: PIC24FJ64GA002 [d4]
Bootloader version: 1,02
```

## UART

It's also possible to set [custom baud rates](http://unwind.se/buspirate-baudrate/) entering the appropriate
raw UXBRG register value.

## I2C

### Example with the ADXL345

Following the [datasheet](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf),
this device has a frequency of 400KHz.

We will try to read the device id that is at address ``0x00``, should return a value of ``0xE5``

```
I2C>W
POWER SUPPLIES ON
I2C>(1)
Searching I2C address space. Found devices at:
0xA6(0x53 W) 0xA7(0x53 R)
I2C>[ 0xA6 0x00 [ 0xa7 r ]
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA6 NACK
WRITE: 0x00 NACK
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA7 ACK
READ: 0xE5
NACK
I2C STOP BIT
```

Register 0x2Dâ€”POWER_CTL (Read/Write) its reset value is ``0x00``, the
important bit is the **measure** one that reflects the measurement state of the
sensor. It's the third bit.

```
I2C>[ 0xa6 0x2d [ 0xa7 r ]
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA6 ACK
WRITE: 0x2D ACK
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA7 ACK
READ: 0x00
NACK
I2C STOP BIT
```

so, uin order to read something we set to 1 the measure bit

```
I2C>[ 0xa6 0x2d 0b00001000]
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA6 ACK 
WRITE: 0x2D ACK 
WRITE: 0x08 ACK 
I2C STOP BIT
```

But the most interesting part is the reading of the actual accelerometer values:
from register ``0x32`` to ``0x37``: we put the accelerometer with the z-axes
pointing upward

```
I2C>[ 0xa6 0x32 [ 0xa7 r:6]
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA6 ACK 
WRITE: 0x32 ACK 
I2C START BIT
WRITE: 0xA7 ACK 
READ: 0x08  ACK 0x00  ACK 0x03  ACK 0x00  ACK 0x00  ACK 0x01 
NACK
I2C STOP BIT
```

## JTAG

In order to use bus pirate with openocd you need to enable it

```
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code
cd code
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --disable-werror --enable-buspirate
make
sudo make install
```

Some informations can be found [here](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Gonemad's_Bus_Pirate/OpenOCD_walk_through).

The cable connection are documented [here](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_JTAG_connections_for_OpenOCD)

| CLK  | TCK | yellow |

## AVR Programming

Can be used with avrdude as is with the following command

```
$ avrdude -c buspirate -p atmega32u4 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```

or is possible to use an alternative firmware in order to emulate the ``STK500``

```
$ avrdude -c stk500v2 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```
