# Sampling&ADC

You need to transform analog input from the real world to something digestible
to the digital world.

Some definition:

 - **Signal to noise ratio:** \\(\hbox{SNR} = {P_\hbox{signal}\over P_\hbox{noise}}\\)
 - **Effective number of bits:** indicated as **ENOB**

this holds
([calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio#Fixed_point))
$$
\hbox{SNR}(db) = 6.02\cdot\hbox{ENOB} + 1.76
$$

## Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem

Signals that differs of \\({1\over T}\\) are sampled the same

## Oversampling and decimation

In same cases you can improve the resolution of your ``ADC`` of \\(n\\) bits
simply summing together \\(f_\hbox{oversampling} = 4^n \cdot f_{\hbox{sampling}}\\)
and then scaling by a factor of \\(s = 2^n\\). This is possible if the following
assumptions hold

 - the signal of interest should not vary significantly during a conversion
 - there should some noise in the signal with amplitude at least 1 ``LSB``
