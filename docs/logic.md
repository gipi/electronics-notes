# Logic

Digital logic uses the boolean logic represented with high and low voltage values:
depending on what voltage represents the /true/ value the logic is **active high** or **active low**.

With technology improvement the voltage ranges used to represent logic level has changed

| Technology | L Voltage | H Voltage |Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------|
|CMOS        |0V to 1/3VDD|2/3 Vdd to Vdd|Vdd = supply voltage |
|TTL |0V to 0.8V | 2V to Vcc | Vcc = 5 +/- 10% |
