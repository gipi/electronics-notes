# Soldering

Keep in mind that the ideal situation is that the soldering iron heats up the joint enough that the
joint melts the solder - not the iron. So the iron is expected to be hotter than the melting point
of the solder so that the entire joint comes up to the melting point of the solder quickly.

## Flux

The [flux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering#Flux) is a tool useful to facilitate the soldering
process reducing oxidation and, in some cases, reducing the surface tension of the molten solder.
